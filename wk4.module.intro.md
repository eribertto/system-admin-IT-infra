Congratulations, you're almost done covering the essential IT infrastructure
services involved in an organization. You're so close, you got this. In the last
module, we learned about the software services used in organization like
communication software, security, and file storage services. Then we talked
about platform services involved in organizations that build a software product.
Finally, we learned about some of the servers that support those organizations
like web and database servers. In this module, we're going to learn about the
last major IT infrastructure service, directory services. It's the beginning of
the end. Ready? Let's jump in.
